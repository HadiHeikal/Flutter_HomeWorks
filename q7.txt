Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur: 

--> dart void main() { String name = "Alice"; name = 123; print(name); }
    1- main function doesn't start with keyword (dart)
    2- name = 123; : Compilation error (statically data type) (we can't change the value of the variable)
